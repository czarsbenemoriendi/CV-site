<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I am most proud of this project. Initially, the website looked completely different. At the very beginning, I created a page that resembled an A4 sheet and served as my portfolio. Then, the project was developed into a web page using pure HTML and CSS. Later, the application was migrated to Vite+Vue.

Currently, I am working on implementing the mockup that I prepared in Figma. I would also like to transfer the project to Nuxt.
